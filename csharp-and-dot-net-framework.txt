C# is a language. but .NET is a framework. Framework means it contained different applications. Some Name of the applications are Consul Application, Windows Applications, Web Applications. .NET Framework is supports more than 20 languages. Its a main difference between .NET and other languages. .NET isn't just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model and you can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries). The opposite isn't necessarily true as you can use other languages to write .NET applications.The distinction between a language and runtime and library is more strict in .NET/C# than for example in C++, where the language specification also includes some basic library functions. The C# specification says only a very little about the environment (basically, that it should contain some types such as int, but that's more or less all).
